# Creating an Event in a Component

### Step 1: Navigate to the Dataflow Page

Navigate to the Dataflow Page by following these [steps](../Naviage%20to%20Dataflow%20Page%2039d9ed3529a94178bf063c9f7ef0bc96.md).

### **Step 2: Add an Event**

On the dataflow page, locate and click on the "Add Event" button. Upon clicking the "Add Event" button, a dialogue box will appear, allowing you to input information about the event you intend to create.

### **Step 3: Enter the Event Name**

Within the dialogue box, you will see a field labeled "Name". Enter a descriptive name for the event you wish to create within the dataflow.

### **Step 4: Review and Verify**

Take a moment to review the event name you've entered to ensure it accurately reflects the purpose of the event.

### **Step 5: Click "Create"**

When you're confident with the entered event name, locate the "Create" button within the dialogue box and click on it.

### **Step 6: Event and Dataflow Creation Process**

After clicking "Create," the platform will process your request and generate the new event within the selected component's dataflow.

The creation process might take a few moments.

### **Step 7: Confirmation and Completion**

Upon successful event creation, you will likely a box with a purple border representing the event. Additionally, you might notice an edge connecting the event to the dataflow.

### **Step 8: Continue Working with Dataflows and Events**

You can continue adding more events or explore other features and options provided by the platform for data modeling and design.

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to work with components, dataflows, and events in a model using the steps outlined in this tutorial
