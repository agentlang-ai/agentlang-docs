# Overview

A fractl model is encoded using [an extensible data notation](https://github.com/edn-format/edn)
with some extensions as supported by the [Clojure programming language](https://clojure.org).
* Fractl source code should be encoded using [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).
* Tokens are separated by whitespace and by the delimiters - `{ } ( ) [ ]`.
* The characters `#` and `'` are also reserved for special purposes as described later in this document.

A fractl program consists of declarations and data-patterns.

## Declarations
A declaration has the following general syntax:

```clojure
(reserved-word identifier specification)
```

*reserved-word* must be one of `component`, `entity`, `relationship`, `event`, `record`, `attribute` or `dataflow`.

*identifier* is a keyword that uniquely identifies the new declaration within the model. An identifier
must start with an alphabet and can consist of alpha-numeric characters. The characters `.` and `/`
can be used in an *identifier*, but they serve a specialized purpose.
Some identifiers automatically generated by the fractl compiler may also contain the `_` character, but this
is not allowed to be used in user-defined identifiers.

The optional *specification* will be a series of data-patterns made up of
[map](https://github.com/edn-format/edn#maps) and [vector](https://github.com/edn-format/edn#vectors) literals.
