# Introduction

**Agentlang** is an open source programming language for building AI agents that can interact with humans and also cooperate among themselves to solve complex problems. Agentlang is not another LLM API or framework written in a traditional programming language, but a whole new declarative language and runtime designed from the ground-up for AI-oriented programming. In Agentlang business problems are expressed as very high-level specifications or models. All the incidental complexities of the application - like interacting with LLM providers, performing CRUD on databases and interfacing with external HTTP APIs - are all abstracted away from the users so that they can fully concentrate on solving the business problem at hand.

Agentlang, with its ultra high-level features, data-oriented syntax and built-in support for intelligent-agents, is the only open source programming tool that can effectively bridge the gap between next-gen AI technologies and traditional business application development.

As the next step, please proceed to [setup Agentlang](installation.md) on your machine and play with simple programs.
