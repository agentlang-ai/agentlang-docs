# Introduction

**Fractl** is a data-oriented, declarative programming language that allows the development of business applications from high-level
models or specifications. Fractl enable developers to focus on the core business requirements of their application, instead of dealing with the wiring logic and resulting accidental complexity.

With Fractl, you can build applications in multiple ways:

1. **Traditional coding**: The complete life-cycle of a Fractl project (design, coding, debugging and deployment) can be managed using your favorite text editor and the `fractl` command-line tool. Fractl models are expressed in a simple and intuitive data-oriented syntax. This means, your Fractl programs can easily integrate with existing plain-text processing tools.
2. **No-code building**: Fractl Design Studio, our no-code builder, allows Fractl models to be designed visually. It also provide an accessible browser-based interface for all aspects of project management. Design Studio is also tightly integrated with the **fractl.io** platform which automates all aspects of deploying and managing planet-scale SaaS applications.
3. **Generative AI**: The very-high-level, declarative nature of Fractl is a phenomenal fit for LLM-driven code generation. The Gen-AI built-into Design Studio can generate ready-to-deploy applications from pure-text descriptions of the business problem.

> **Note**: Currently, Fractl supports backend development - but has been designed to be a full-stack abstraction (frontend is on our roadmap).

As the next step, please proceed to [setup Fractl](installation.md) on your machine and play with simple programs.
