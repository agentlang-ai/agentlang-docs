# Introduction

**Fractl** is a Generative AI-powered programming language. **Fractl** enables developers to focus on the core business requirements of their application, instead of dealing with the wiring logic and resulting accidental complexity.

With **Fractl**, you can build applications in multiple ways:

1. **Traditional coding**: Fractl Programming Language brings a business-level programming abstraction, numerous innovations and a modern, data-oriented syntax to power-charge development.
2. **No-code building**: Fractl Design Studio, our no-code builder, makes software development incredibly simple and accessible.
3. **Generative AI**: The business-level abstraction of Fractl is a phenomenal fit for LLM-driven code generation.

> **Note**: Currently, Fractl supports backend development - but has been designed to be a full-stack abstraction (frontend is on our roadmap).

‚Äç**Fractl.io**, the Generative AI platform for developing applications, lets developers build cloud-native, planet-scale SaaS apps 100x faster.

# Get Started

We recommend the following steps to get started with **Fractl**:

1. Learn key concepts from the **[Concepts Guide](docs/concepts/intro.md)**
2. Pick your favorite way of building applications:
    1. **Traditional coding**: Follow the installation guide to install Fractl and start building in your favorite IDE. 
        1. Study an example application in Fractl: [Blog](/docs/blog-example/intro.md)
        2. Use the [Language Reference](language/overview.md) to learn Fractl's simple, data-oriented syntax.
    2. **No-code and Gen AI**: Request access to **Fractl Design Studio** on fractl.io and start building in no time.

# Salient Features of Fractl

## Fractl is tri-modal
With Fractl, you can develop applications in three different ways - Generative AI, a no-code designer or conventional textually programming in an IDE. Fractl is designed to accommodate developers with varied preferences. Whether you're rooted in traditional code, lean towards a visual interface, or wish to harness AI for development, Fractl has a mode tailored for you. This makes the language inclusive, catering to a wide array of developers.

## Fractl is declarative
Fractl introduces a declarative layer, enabling developers to express intent without delving into the specifics of the implementation. This ensures that your focus remains on addressing the business problem at hand rather than getting entangled in the technicalities.

## Fractl language syntax is data-oriented
The syntax in Fractl adopts a pure data structure. This uniformity ensures predictability, facilitating easier validation and manipulation by new forms of innovative developer tools. It also paves the way for smoother integration with third-party tools and platforms.

## Fractl is open
Fractl is the only low-code platform that is truly open. Fractl is not just open source, Fractl programs are portable across platforms: they can be run anywhere you can deploy the fractl runtime.
