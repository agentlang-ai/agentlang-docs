# Introduction

**Agentlang** is an open source programming language for building AI agents that can interact with humans and also cooperate amoung themselves to solve complex problems. Agentlang is not a mere LLM API or framework written in a traditional programming language, but a whole new declarative language and runtime where business problems are expressed as very high-level specifications or models. All the incidental complexities of the application - like interacting with LLM providers, performing CRUD on databases or interacting with external HTTP APIs - are all abstracted away from the user so that she can fully concentrate on solving the business problem at hand.

Agentlang, with its ultra high-level programming model, data-oriented syntax and built-in support for intelligent-agents, is the only open source programming tool that can effectively bridge the gap between next-gen LLM technologies and traditional business application development.

As the next step, please proceed to [setup Agentlang](installation.md) on your machine and play with simple programs.
