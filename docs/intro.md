# Introduction

**Agentlang** is a very high-level, declarative, open source programming language designed for solving complex business problems with the help of *Intelligent Agents*. Agents can be made to interact among themselves to come up with innovative workflows based on a high-level model of the business domain. Agents may also interact with humans for information gathering, verification of processes etc.

Agentlang is not just another LLM framework written in a traditional programming language, but a new declarative language and runtime designed from the ground-up for AI-oriented programming. In Agentlang business problems are expressed as very high-level specifications or models. All the incidental complexities of the application - like interacting with LLM providers, performing CRUD on databases and interfacing with external HTTP APIs - are all abstracted away from the users so they are free to work at the level of the business domain.

Agentlang, with its ultra high-level features, data-oriented syntax and built-in support for intelligent-agents, is the only open source programming tool that can effectively bridge the gap between next-gen AI technologies and traditional business application development.

As the next step, please proceed to [setup Agentlang](installation.md) on your machine and play with a few simple programs.
