# Creating a Record in a Component

### **Step 1: Click on the Model Card**

Locate the model card that you want to add a component to. Click on the card representing the desired model. This will take you to the data model page for that particular model.

### **Step 2: Check for Existing Components**

If the model already contains components, they will likely be pre-selected when you access the model's Data model page.

If the model is empty, you must create a component following the instructions provided in the link: [How to Create a Component.](../components/create-component.md)

### **Step 3: Navigate Between Components (If Applicable)**

If the model contains more than one component, you can navigate between these components by clicking on the corresponding component tabs, which are usually displayed at the top and side of the page.

### **Step 4: Add a Record**

On the detailed Data model page, locate and click on the "Add Record" button.

Clicking the "Add Record" button will open a dialogue box where you can provide information about the record you want to create.

### **Step 5: Enter the Record Name**

Within the dialogue box, you'll see a field labeled "Name". Enter a descriptive name for the record you wish to create within the data model.

### **Step 6: Review and Verify**

Take a moment to review the record name you've entered to ensure accuracy.

### **Step 7: Click "Create"**

Once you're confident with the entered record name, find the "Create" button within the dialogue box and click on it.

### **Step 8: Record Creation Process**

After clicking "Create," the platform will process your request and generate a new record within the selected component of the model.

The creation process might take a few seconds.

### **Step 9: Confirmation and Completion**

Upon successful record creation, you will see the box with the blue border on the canvas.

### **Step 10: Continue Working with Components and Records**

You can continue adding more records to the same component or explore other features and options provided by the platform for data modeling and design.
