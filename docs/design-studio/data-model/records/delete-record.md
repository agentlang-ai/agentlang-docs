# Deleting a Record from a Component

### **Step 1: Click on the Model Card**

Locate the model card that you want to add a component to. Click on the card representing the desired model. This will take you to the data model page for that particular model.

### **Step 2: Check for Existing Components**

If the model already contains components, they will likely be pre-selected when you access the model's Data model page.

If the model is empty, you must create a component following the instructions provided in the link: [How to Create a Component.](../components/create-component.md)

### **Step 3: Navigate Between Components (If Applicable)**

If the model contains more than one component, you can navigate between these components by clicking on the corresponding component tabs, which are usually displayed at the top and side of the page.

### **Step 4: Select the Record**

On the data model's detailed page, choose the record you want to delete:

- **Option 1:** Find the record's name in the left panel and click on it.
- **Option 2:** Click on the record itself (identified by a green border box) within the canvas.

### **Step 5: Open the Record's Panel**

Upon selecting the record, a panel will open on the right-hand side of the page. This panel typically contains information related to the chosen record.

### **Step 6: Delete the Record**

Within the opened record panel, locate and click on the "trash" icon. This icon is used to initiate the process of deleting the selected record.

### **Step 7: Confirmation Prompt**

After clicking the "trash" icon, you may receive a confirmation prompt to ensure you want to proceed with the deletion. This prompt is designed to prevent accidental deletion.

### **Step 8: Confirm Deletion**

If a confirmation prompt appears, review the message to ensure you indeed want to delete the record. If you are certain about the deletion, proceed by clicking the "Delete" button, as indicated in the prompt.

### **Step 9: Record Deletion Process**

After confirming the deletion, the platform will begin the process of removing the selected record from the data model. Depending on the platform and the complexity of the record, the deletion process might take a few seconds.

### **Step 10: Review and Continue**

Review the data model page to ensure that the deleted record is no longer present. You can now proceed with other actions, such as editing other entities or adding new ones.

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to delete a record from a model using the steps outlined in this tutorial.
