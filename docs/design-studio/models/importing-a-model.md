A dialogue box will appear on your screen. This dialogue box is where you'll enter
the necessary information to import the desired model.

### **Step 2: Enter Model Details**

In the dialogue box, there will be fields to enter specific information about the model you want to import:

-   **Model Name:** Type in the name of the model you intend to import. This should be the exact name by which the model is identified.
-   **GitHub Organization:** Enter the name of the GitHub organization where the model is stored.

### **Step 3: Click "Import"**

Once you have verified the information you entered, locate the "Import" button within the dialogue box and click on it.
Now Design Studio will start the process of fetching the model from the specified GitHub organization.
Wait for the import process to complete. Once the import process is complete, you will see the model card on the dashboard.

### **Step 4: Access the Imported Model**

At this point, the imported model should be available in the Design Studio's model card list.
