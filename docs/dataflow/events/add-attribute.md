### **Step 7: Assign Identifier and Default Value (Optional)**

Depending on your needs and the platform's capabilities, you might have additional options to consider:

- **Identifier:** You can assign an identifier to the attribute to indicate uniqueness or other characteristics. This could include options like "unique," "optional," etc.
- **Default Value:** You can also assign an optional default value to the attribute, which is used when no specific value is provided.

### **Step 8: Review and Verify**

Take a moment to review the attribute name, type, identifier options, and default value (if applicable) to ensure accuracy.

### **Step 9: Click "Create"**

Once you are satisfied with the attribute details, locate the "Create" button within the dialogue box and click on it.

### **Step 10: Attribute Addition Process**

After clicking "Create," the platform will process your request and add the new attribute to the selected event.

Depending on the complexity of the event and the platform's performance, the attribute addition process might take a few moments.

### **Step 11: Confirmation and Completion**

Upon successful attribute addition, you will likely receive a confirmation message indicating that the attribute has been added to the event.
